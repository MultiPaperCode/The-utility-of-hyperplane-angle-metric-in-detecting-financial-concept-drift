1. **Disclaimer**:  
   Our code includes the decomposition of kernel functions, making it easier to observe in the MATLAB environment. If you intend to reuse this code, you must possess a sufficient mathematical foundation to derive the SVM process, as it involves the extraction and computation of hyperplanes. The following derivations are sufficient to observe the relationship between two points.  

2. **Proof of SVM (Derivation Process)**:  
   Focus on the changes in the hyperplane to better understand our method:

   If you have difficulty understanding the derivations, you can experiment with the demos available on the following website, which will help clarify the proofs in the paper.  

3. **Code for This Paper**:  
   *The Utility of Hyperplane Angle Metric in Detecting Financial Concept Drift*.  
   You only need to install the **LIBSVM toolbox** to run it.  

4. **Special Notes**:  
   - Our objective is to identify the degree of variation in classification boundaries within the space, not to focus on financial tasks or the properties of SVM.  
   - Our method can be extended to any machine learning approach.

6. **Feedback from Researchers**:  
   Some researchers have already executed my code and provided positive feedback, including:  
   - A Ph.D. candidate from Wuhan University  
   - A quantitative researcher in the U.S.  
   - A researcher from Peking University  

7. **Questions & Discussion**:  
   I raise the following questionsâ€”if you have any insights, feel free to contact me:  
   - Why are deep learning models not well-suited for quantitative trading?  
   - What challenges does depth introduce?  
   - How can the conflict between fixed and dynamic elements be resolved?  
   - How can mathematical models be nested within deep learning networks for quantitative applications?
